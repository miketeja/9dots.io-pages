## Overview
Students are challenged to construct a Rube Goldberg machine using limited resources, with the task of pushing a Lego car forward using a marble. Students focus on mechanical energy transfer using various mechanical devices. 

As the unit moves on and more energy device transfers are introduced, students will utilize Little Bits inputs and outputs to add to the complexity of their Rube Goldberg machines. 

## Setup
### materials:
- Per Group:
	- 1 cardboard box
    - 2 12" foam tubing pieces
    - 1 marble
    - 10 dominos
    - 1 prebuilt Lego car
- Per Class:
	- extra cardboard
    - tape
    - scissors
    - stopwatch

### project time:
- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes
 
1. Explain a Rube Goldberg machine to students. 
	- A Rube Goldberg is a contraption or device that is purposely over-engineered to perform a very simple task in a very complicated fashion, usually including a chain reaction (i.e. move a marble through a series of events to reach a destination).
2. Show students [OK GO music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w) to provide an example of a Rube Goldberg machine.

## Explain - 5 minutes
Begin the lesson with a brief introduction of energy and energy transfer.

1. Explain to students the concept of energy:
	
    - Law of Conservation of Energy: The total amount of energy in a system is conserved, although energy can be changed from one form to another or transferred from one object to another. 
		- Energy cannot be created or destroyed 
	- Mechanical Energy: Energy that is possessed by an object due to its motion or position
		- Kinetic energy: Energy of motion
		- Potential energy: Stored energy of position 
			- In this lesson, focus on Mechanical Energy and the transfer of potential to kinetic energy
			- Demonstrate this by having two ramps present at different heights. Ask students which has more energy (the higher car), and which car will travel the furthest.
	- Mechanical device: a device or piece of the Rube Goldberg that can transfer from potential to kinetic energy (i.e. moving marble, falling dominos, releasing a spring, moving a car, etc.)
		- Electrical, chemical, thermal, and optical devices will later be introduced into the Rube Goldberg machines. 

## Explore - 30 minutes
Challenge: Students are to construct a Rube Goldberg machine using all of the materials listed previously that will successfully move a lego car forward using energy transfer
  
- Students must keep their Rube Goldberg mechanical devices within the cardboard set (the car may be outside of the box)
- Students must use all materials provided
- The group that successfully pushes the car forward with the longest running time wins(timing is stopped once car stops moving).

## Evaluate - 5 minutes
Test each groupâ€™s machine and measure whose car travels the further distance on the floor!
