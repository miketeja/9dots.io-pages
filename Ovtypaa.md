## Overview
Students are challenged to construct a Rube Goldberg machine using limited resources, with the task of pushing a Lego car forward using a marble. Students focus on mechanical energy transfer using various mechanical devices. 

As the unit moves on and more energy device transfers are introduced, students will utilize Little Bits inputs and outputs to add to the complexity of their Rube Goldberg machines. 

## Setup
### materials:
- Per Group:
	- 1 cardboard box
    - 2 12" foam tubing pieces
    - 1 marble
    - 10 dominos
    - 1 prebuilt Lego car
