## Overview
Students are challenged to construct a Rube Goldberg machine using limited resources, with the task of pushing a Lego car forward using a marble. Students focus on mechanical energy transfer using various mechanical devices. 

## Setup
### materials:
- Per Group:
	- 1 cardboard box
    - 2 12" foam tubing pieces
    - 1 marble
    - 10 dominos
    - 1 prebuilt Lego car
- Per Class:
	- extra cardboard
    - tape
    - scissors
    - stopwatch

### project time:
- 45 minutes

## Engage - 5 minutes
 
1. Explain a Rube Goldberg machine to students. 
	- A Rube Goldberg is a contraption or device that is purposely over-engineered to perform a very simple task in a very complicated fashion, usually including a chain reaction (i.e. move a marble through a series of events to reach a destination).
2. Show students [OK GO music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w) to provide an example of a Rube Goldberg machine.

## Explain - 5 minutes
Begin the lesson with a brief introduction of energy and energy transfer.

1. Explain to students the concept of energy:
	
    - Law of Conservation of Energy: The total amount of energy in a system is conserved, although energy can be changed from one form to another or transferred from one object to another. 
		- Energy cannot be created or destroyed 
	- Mechanical Energy: Energy that is possessed by an object due to its motion or position
		- Kinetic energy: Energy of motion
		- Potential energy: Stored energy of position 
			- In this lesson, focus on Mechanical Energy and the transfer of potential to kinetic energy
			- Demonstrate this by having two ramps present at different heights. Ask students which has more energy (the higher car), and which car will travel the furthest.
	- Mechanical device: a device or piece of the Rube Goldberg that can transfer from potential to kinetic energy (i.e. moving marble, falling dominos, releasing a spring, moving a car, etc.)
		- Electrical, chemical, thermal, and optical devices will later be introduced into the Rube Goldberg machines. 

## Explore - 30 minutes
Challenge: Students are to construct a Rube Goldberg machine using all of the materials listed previously that will successfully move a lego car forward using energy transfer
  
- Students must keep their Rube Goldberg mechanical devices within the cardboard set (the car may be outside of the box)
- Students must use all materials provided
- The group that successfully pushes the car forward with the longest running time wins(timing is stopped once car stops moving).

## Evaluate - 5 minutes
Test each groupâ€™s machine and measure whose car travels the further distance on the floor!
