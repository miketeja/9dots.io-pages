## Setup
### Materials (per student)

- Paper plate
- 6 button magnets (½ - ¾ inch diameter)
- Cardboard base
- Paper
- 2 alligator clips
- Insulated copper wire
- 2 notecards
### Materials (for class)

- Hot glue gun 
- Speaker wire
- Amplifier

### Project Time:

- 90 minutes

##Day 1

## Engage - 10 minutes

1. Show [Resonance experiment video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJAgrUBF4w)
	- Ask students how they think the salt is moving?
2. Bring out a large speaker. Before playing anything, ask students what they think will happen when it is turned on to a high volume?
	- Why does it shake, or vibrate, more when it is turned higher?
3. Inform to students the lesson is to build their own, personal speakers using simple household objects!

## Explore - 25 minutes

1. Prepare a pre made coil of insulated copper wire and a stack of 6 magnets to show students the final product for day 1.
2. Students will complete the first 2 steps of the project at this point.
	- Provide each student with 3 magnets stacked upon one another
	- Select one of the pieces of paper. Wrap the paper around the magnet  and tape the ends. Cut off the remainder so the paper wrapping is the same height and width of the magnets. 
	- Select the other piece of paper. Wrap this paper around the first layer as well as the magnets. Wrap the paper all the way around such that when it is taped, it does not stick to any of the first layer paper.
	- With both layers of wrapping and the magnets inside, wrap the insulated copper wire tightly around the cylinder (60-70 times). Leave about 6-8 inches of loose wire on both the top and the bottom. Hot glue each end to ensure the wire stays coiled. 
	- Remove the magnet from inside.
	- Remove the first layer of paper wrapping from inside.

3. Demo: Using your premade wire wrapping, show students how voltage can be generated using only the copper wire spool and the magnet. 
	- Galvanometer: measures an electric current
	- Connect the galvanometer ends to 2 aligator clips, and connect the alligator clips to the ends of the copper wire spool. 
	- Demonstrate the when the magnet is not present, the voltage reads zero, however, when the magnet is present, there is a positive and negative reading as the magnet makes a complete “loop” through the coiled wire

## Explain - 10 minutes
How the magnet generates a current in the copper wire

1. All metals contain a movable substance called "electric charge,” and have positive protons and negative electrons. 
2. Metals are special because the atoms float more freely and are constantly moving throughout the metal, sometimes called an “electron sea,” as they float through the metal and are easily movable. 
3. When a magnetic field is presented, a voltage appears and causes the movable charges inside to rotates around the circular wire, ultimately causing eletric currents to flow through the wire. Everytime the magnet moves, or oscillates, through the coiled wire, a pumping action is caused and the charges will flow. This is referred to as “Electromagnetic Induction.” The current flows in one (positive) direction, then moves back in the other (negative) direction, hence the alternating positive and negative readings on the galvanometer.

How the magnet generates a current in the copper wire

1. Define sound: vibrations that travel through the air or another medium and can be heard when they reach a person's or animal's ear.
2. A speaker is simply a device that allows sound to travel more efficiently 
3. In it's simplest form, a speaker is just a coil of wire glued to a piece of paper, and placed near a permanent magnet.  
	- When alternating current from an audio source flows through the coiled wire, it is either attracted, or repelled by the permanent magnet.  
	- The audio signal from your stereo is a form of alternating current.   When attached to a coil of wire and set near a stable magnetic field, the variations in polarity and amplitude will make it vibrate thousands upon thousands of times per second.  
	- Because there is vibration, speakers often shake as the sound is emitted from the audio source

(*NOTE: Students may bring an old pair of headphones to the next lesson if they have a pair, remind them these will be cut)
